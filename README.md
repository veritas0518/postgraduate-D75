# postgraduate-D75
Too many things have happened recently. I'm going to collapse. Going abroad and self-study by computer are really pressing me out of breath, but I can't help it. I always have to face things one by one. I really feel that 24 hours a day is not enough. Now I'm doing things with one mind, two or even three uses, mainly because the two things I'm facing are very difficult, I'm so busy that I can't even eat. I really can't stand the high-intensity study of computer major. It's really not a human life. It may be more difficult in September. Ha ha, I'm speechless. I have nothing to say. I have to learn English.
